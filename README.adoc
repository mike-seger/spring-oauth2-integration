= OAuth 2.0 Integration Sample

This sample integrates `spring-security-oauth2-client` and `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` with *Spring Authorization Server*.

== Run the Sample

* Run Authorization Server -> `./gradlew -b authorizationserver/build.gradle bootRun`
* Run Resource Server -> `./gradlew -b resourceserver/build.gradle bootRun`
* Run Client -> `./gradlew -b client/build.gradle bootRun`
* Go to `http://localhost:39001`

** *IMPORTANT:* For the Authorization Flow: Make sure to modify your `/etc/hosts` file to avoid problems with session cookie overwrites between `client` and `authorizationserver`. Simply add the entry `127.0.0.1	auth-server`

== Enabling SSL
For each of the servers ssl profiles can be set:
./gradlew -Dspring.profiles.active=ssl ...

=== client
ssl-2way-client

=== authorizationserver
ssl
ssl-2way,ssl (TODO: ssl is not included automatically)

=== resourceserver
ssl-2way,ssl-2way-client (all 2-way)
ssl-2way-client (no ssl server)
